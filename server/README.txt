Unturned Util (server)

This is the server side of the project.
Unlike the other application, this is a command-line program.

The only feature enhanced by connecting to a server is AutoTPA.
Having your team all connect to the same server, with usernames the same as they appear in-game, will allow TPAs sent by clients to be instantly accepted by other members connected to the server.
If it isn't obvious, only run it when you need, and only for your team.

Once the server is up, type 'help' for some useful commands.

To run, type the following command:
	py unturned_util_server.py
