# Unturned-Util
A small program which provides you and your team the ability to coordinate better and act more efficiently in the video game Unturned with the use of macros and communication between clients.

# Features:
Each feature below can be bound to any key you like (although due to system limitations some keys will not work):
- **quicktype:** Macro to quickly type anything in chat
- **autoTPA:** Macro to quickly send TPAs to your teammates; if you are both connected to the Unturned-Util server, they will also be automatically accepted
- **combat log:** Force quit the game in order to escape a bad situation
- **nightvision:** Change your system's gamma settings to see at night
- **input spam:** Spam any keyboard/mouse button quickly, useful for grabbing items off the ground quickly or crafting large quantities of items

Having your keyboard directly bound to these functions can be annoying if, for instance, you want to type something in chat without being interrupted by one of your binds. To try to correct for this, there is also a **pause inputs** feature, which when pressed will prevent the program from listening to your keyboard until pressed again. 

# Running the program:
Both the main project directory and the server directory contain instructions on how to run each of the clientside and serverside programs.
