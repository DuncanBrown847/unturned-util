Unturned Util (client)

This program was designed for the purpose of winning more in the video game Unturned.
It allows you to set up macros that will assist you and your team do things more efficiently, such as picking up items or doing /tpa.

Keep in mind that the features in this program interact directly with your system and your keyboard inputs, NOT the game itself. 
For instance, an autoTPA bind will not actually interact at all with the game instance when sending a tpa. It simply types the required command, just really quickly.

To run:
From the same directory as this readme file, run the following command:
	py lib/guimain.py
(I intend to add a more streamlined way to run the program in the future)

Things to note:
	- When connecting to server, be mindful that the program is running while you type in the server IP and your username. Consider pausing input before typing IP or username.
	- Currently, the only way to redo/adjust a config is to delete it and re-launch the program. It is stored in './bin'.
	- For features with multiple possible targets, there is no way to delete an added target "profile" in ther config menu. However, if you leave all fields blank, the config will ignore it.
	- There is also no way to currently save connection info so be prepared to retype it each time. :(
	-'bin' is not short for binary. It's short for 'bin of stuff'. :)
