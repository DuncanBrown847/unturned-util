Unturned Util v0.1
by candsbrown

To run:
From the same directory as this readme file, run the following command:
	py lib/guimain.py

Things to note:
	- When connecting to server, be mindful that the program is unning while you type. Consider pausing before typing IP or username.
	- Currently, the only way to redo/adjust a config is to delete it and re-launch the program. It is stored in './bin'.
	- For features with multiple possible targets, there is no way to delete an added target "profile" in ther config menu. However, if you leave all fields blank, the config will ignore it.
	- There is also no way to currently save connection info so be prepared to retype it each time. :(
